# MazeWithReinforcementLearning
 
This project implements two reinforcement learning agents, Q-Learning and Policy Gradient, to solve a maze environment. The agents learn to navigate from a start position to a goal within a maze by taking actions based on their learned policies. The project includes a simple GUI to select the agent type and visualize the agent's performance during training, showing learning curves and rendering the agentâ€™s movements in the maze.

After running the main, a window appears to allow the user to select the agent he wants to train
Then the training process begins with two curves showing the rewards and the steps taken in each episode
After finishing the training, there is a plot of the agent selecting the best path found
